Now the New York Times bestselling author shoots to thrill again with Do or Die. Navy SEAL Ian Dunn went rogue in a big way when he turned his talents to a lawless life of jewel heists and con jobs. Or so the world has been led to believe. In reality, the former Special Ops warrior is still fighting for good, leading a small band of freelance covert operatives who take care of high-stakes business in highly unofficial ways. That makes Ian the hands-down choice when the U.S. government must breach a heavily guarded embassy and rescue a pair of children kidnapped by their own father, a sinister foreign national willing to turn his kids into casualties. Shockingly, Ian passes on the mission for reasons he will not—or cannot—reveal. But saying no is not an option. Especially not for Phoebe Kruger, Ian’s beautiful and unexpectedly brash new attorney. Determined to see the abducted children set free, Phoebe not only gets Ian on board but insists on riding shotgun on his Mission: Impossible–style operation, whether he likes it or not. Though Phoebe has a valuable knack for getting out of tight spots, there’s no denying the intensely intimate feelings growing between Ian and Phoebe as the team gears up for combat. But these are feelings they both must fight to control as they face an array of cold-blooded adversaries, including a vindictive mob boss who’s got Ian at the top of his hit list and a wealthy psychopath who loves murder as much as he loves money. As they dodge death squads and play lethal games of deception, Ian and Phoebe will do whatever it takes to save the innocent and vanquish the guilty—or die trying. Praise for Do or Die “This is action-adventure on steroids with an interwoven romance or two, maybe three or even four in full bloom or on the cusp of blossoming. From the start, I’m recommending that you keep an eye out for the next book in this Reluctant Heroes series. Here’s a vote for Martell Griffin’s story. [Suzanne] Brockmann writes with the imagination running free and on the wild side. What’s not to love about that? . . . Suspense remains high at octane levels, and the romance is served up with witty banter, ultrasexiness and very poignant moments.”—USA Today “Fans of Suzanne Brockmann’s military suspense novels need not worry. There’s a new cast of intriguing, smart and buff characters (both the men and the women), but the adrenaline-driven pace and crafty plotting are pure Brockmann. . . . As the team members dispersed, I looked forward to reading their tales, knowing that master storyteller Brockmann will deliver them as she did in the seventeen Troubleshooters books.”—Tampa Bay Times “Brockmann effortlessly and expertly tosses hundreds of details into the air and juggles them with brilliance. The first in her Reluctant Heroes series, the novel will captivate readers with its intense, action-filled plot, alpha-and-a-half hero, and his smart, perfect-for-him heroine, as well as secondary characters who contribute pathos and humor.

Embracing solitude in his remote cabin in the Blue Ridge Mountains, Ike thought he\'d left the War on Terror far behind. Now he\'s stuck shielding a blue-eyed beauty from ambitious federal agents and crazed jihadists. More disturbing still, the charming Eryn seems intent on shattering his self-imposed isolation. Ike does his best to resist her welcoming ways, but he can feel his restraint eroding like a mountain in a mudslide.

This belief is shared by the “Legendary Lieutenant” Joe Leaphorn, who once again is pulled out of retirement by the possibility of serious wrongs being committed against the Navajo nation by the Washington bureaucracy. Yet it is former policewoman Bernadette Manuelito, recently relocated to the Border Patrol at the U.S.–Mexico line, who possibly holds the key to a fiendishly twisted conspiracy of greed, lies, and murder—and whose only hope for survival now rests in the hands of friends too far away for comfort.','Harper Collins','2011-10-25','http://books.google.com/books?id=DkXWPAZBGjcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+sinister+pig&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DkXWPAZBGjcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','DkXWPAZBGjcC','PHY',NULL,1,4),(11,'50 Artists You Should Know','Contains entries about fifty notable artists, ranging from the thirteenth century through the twentieth century, providing biographical information, time lines, and critical analyses of their works.','Not Present','2016-02-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=8xynDAEACAAJ&dq=50+Artists&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=8xynDAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','8xynDAEACAAJ','PHY',NULL,1,2),(12,'GRE Vocabulary Flashcards','Kaplan\'s GRE Verbal Workbook provides hundreds of realistic practice questions to help you get comfortable and confident with the Verbal section of the test.

The bestselling author of The Surgeon returns—and so does that chilling novel’s diabolical villain. Though held behind bars, Warren Hoyt still haunts a helpless city, seeming to bequeath his evil legacy to a student all-too-diligent . . . and all-too-deadly. It is a boiling hot Boston summer. Adding to the city’s woes is a series of shocking crimes, in which wealthy men are made to watch while their wives are brutalized. A sadistic demand that ends in abduction and death. The pattern suggests one man: serial killer Warren Hoyt, recently removed from the city’s streets. Police can only assume an acolyte is at large, a maniac basing his attacks on the twisted medical techniques of the madman he so admires. At least that’s what Detective Jane Rizzoli thinks. Forced again to confront the killer who scarred her—literally and figuratively—she is determined to finally end Hoyt’s awful influence . . . even if it means receiving more resistance from her all-male homicide squad. But Rizzoli isn’t counting on the U.S. government’s sudden interest. Or on meeting Special Agent Gabriel Dean, who knows more than he will tell. Most of all, she isn’t counting on becoming a target herself, once Hoyt is suddenly free, joining his mysterious blood brother in a vicious vendetta. . . . Filled with superbly created characters—and the medical and police procedural details that are her trademark—The Apprentice is Tess Gerritsen at her brilliant best. Set in a stunning world where evil is easy to learn and hard to end, this is a thriller by a master who could teach other authors a thing or two.

As a result of that night, she joined two friends—also survivors—in starting The Last Stand, an organization to help victims of crime. But now, her would-be rapist is getting out of prison.

Caught between two complicated and determined women, trying to understand Linton’s passionate distrust of Adams, the facts surrounding Chief Tolliver’s death, and the complexities of this insular town, Trent will unleash a case filled with explosive secrets—and encounter a thin blue line that could be murderous if crossed.

Evil is bad that believes it’s good.” MacKayla Lane was just a child when she and her sister, Alina, were given up for adoption and banished from Ireland forever. Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister’s murderer. But after discovering that she descends from a bloodline both gifted and cursed, Mac is plunged into a secret history: an ancient conflict between humans and immortals who have lived concealed among us for thousands of years. What follows is a shocking chain of events with devastating consequences, and now Mac struggles to cope with grief while continuing her mission to acquire and control the Sinsar Dubh—a book of dark, forbidden magic scribed by the mythical Unseelie King, containing the power to create and destroy worlds. In an epic battle between humans and Fae, the hunter becomes the hunted when the Sinsar Dubh turns on Mac and begins mowing a deadly path through those she loves. Who can she turn to? Who can she trust? Who is the woman haunting her dreams? More important, who is Mac herself and what is the destiny she glimpses in the black and crimson designs of an ancient tarot card? From the luxury of the Lord Master’s penthouse to the sordid depths of an Unseelie nightclub, from the erotic bed of her lover to the terrifying bed of the Unseelie King, Mac’s journey will force her to face the truth of her exile, and to make a choice that will either save the world . . . or destroy it.

That is, until a curse strips him of his immortality and makes him invisible, a cruel fate for so irresistible a man. With his very life at stake, Adam’s only hope for survival is in the hands of the one woman who can actually see him. Enter law student Gabrielle O’Callaghan, who is cursed with the ability to see both worlds: Mortal and Faery. From the moment she lays eyes on this stunning male, Gabby is certain of one thing: He could be her undoing. Thus begins a long, dangerous seduction.

Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne’s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and paganism, while Roland’s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.

Similarly neither can one day, or a brief space of time, make a man blessed and happy\" Previously published as Ethics, Aristotle\'s The Nicomachean Ethics addresses the question of how to live well and originates the concept of cultivating a virtuous character as the basis of his ethical system. Here Aristotle sets out to examine the nature of happiness, and argues that happiness consists in \'activity of the soul in accordance with virtue\', including moral virtues, such as courage, generosity and justice, and intellectual virtues, such as knowledge, wisdom and insight. The Ethics also discusses the nature of practical reasoning, the value and the objects of pleasure, the different forms of friendship, and the relationship between individual virtue, society and the State. Aristotle\'s work has had a profound and lasting influence on all subsequent Western thought about ethical matters. This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Greek by J.A.K.

With documentaries like I Am Not Your Negro bringing renewed interest to Baldwin\'s life and work, Notes of a Native Son serves as a valuable introduction. Written during the 1940s and early 1950s, when Baldwin was only in his twenties, the essays collected in Notes of a Native Son capture a view of black life and black thought at the dawn of the civil rights movement and as the movement slowly gained strength through the words of one of the most captivating essayists and foremost intellectuals of that era. Writing as an artist, activist, and social critic, Baldwin probes the complex condition of being black in America. With a keen eye, he examines everything from the significance of the protest novel to the motives and circumstances of the many black expatriates of the time, from his home in “The Harlem Ghetto” to a sobering “Journey to Atlanta.” Notes of a Native Son inaugurated Baldwin as one of the leading interpreters of the dramatic social changes erupting in the United States in the twentieth century, and many of his observations have proven almost prophetic. His criticism on topics such as the paternalism of white progressives or on his own friend Richard Wright’s work is pointed and unabashed. He was also one of the few writing on race at the time who addressed the issue with a powerful mixture of outrage at the gross physical and political violence against black citizens and measured understanding of their oppressors, which helped awaken a white audience to the injustices under their noses. Naturally, this combination of brazen criticism and unconventional empathy for white readers won Baldwin as much condemnation as praise. Notes is the book that established Baldwin’s voice as a social critic, and it remains one of his most admired works. The essays collected here create a cohesive sketch of black America and reveal an intimate portrait of Baldwin’s own search for identity as an artist, as a black man, and as an American.','Beacon Press','2012-11-20','http://books.google.com/books?id=fNpmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=notes+of+a+native+son+baldwin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fNpmDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','fNpmDwAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(217,'XPD','Not Present','Not Present','1982-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=Ijq09pj_D2cC&q=len+deighton+xpd+ballantine&dq=len+deighton+xpd+ballantine&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ijq09pj_D2cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','Ijq09pj_D2cC','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(218,'Hope','Bernard Samson returns to Berlin in the second novel in the classic spy trilogy, FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY.','HarperCollins UK','2011-06-09','http://books.google.com/books?id=qsf-y-WFrNEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=len+deighton+hope+harper&hl=&cd=3&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=qsf-y-WFrNEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','qsf-y-WFrNEC','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(219,'Faith','Bernard Samson returns to Berlin in the first novel in the classic spy trilogy, FAITH, HOPE and CHARITY','HarperCollins UK','2011-06-09','http://books.google.com/books?id=hUQWJuCysvQC&pg=PP1&dq=len+deighton+faith+harper&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hUQWJuCysvQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','hUQWJuCysvQC','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(220,'Spy Line','The long-awaited reissue of the second part of the classic spy trilogy, HOOK, LINE and SINKER, when the Berlin Wall divided not just a city but a world.','HarperCollins UK','2010-09-30','http://books.google.com/books?id=Ts5gmzjnysEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=len+deighton+spy+line+harper&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Ts5gmzjnysEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Ts5gmzjnysEC','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(221,'Spy Sinker','\'Dazzling ingenuity and cleverness\' Independent \'Chilling ... the writing is crisp and brutal\' Daily Telegraph Of all the mysteries Bernard Samson has encountered, the greatest is his wife Fiona.

His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990, which examines, for example, the sources and influences of the work, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem\'s early reception.

Dashing, captivating Adam Lang was Britain\'s longest serving -- and most controversial -- prime minister of the last half century, whose career ended in tatters after he sided with America in an unpopular war on terror. Now, after stepping down in disgrace, Lang is hiding out in wintry Martha\'s Vineyard to finish his much sought-after, potentially explosive memoir, for which he accepted one of history\'s largest cash advances. But the project runs aground when his ghostwriter suddenly and mysteriously disappears and later washes up, dead, on the island\'s deserted shore. Enter our hero -- Lang\'s new ghostwriter -- cynical, mercenary, and quick with a line of deadpan humor. Accustomed to working with fading rock stars and minor celebrities, he jumps at the chance to be the new ghost of Adam Lang\'s memoirs, especially as it means a big payday. At once he flies to Lang\'s remote location in America to finish the book in the seclusion of a luxurious estate, but it doesn\'t take him long to realize he has made a fatal error in judgment. The state of affairs is grim enough when the ghost begins to unearth the bone-chilling circumstances of his predecessor\'s death. And before long, he discovers that the ex-prime minister is not just a charismatic politician who made a few mistakes. He\'s a dark, tortured man with haunting secrets in his past -- secrets with the power to alter world politics. Secrets with the power to kill. Robert Harris is known the world over as a master of his trade. The Ghost is yet another signature, brilliant tour de force that will compel, captivate, and excite readers to the very last shocking page.','Simon and Schuster','2007-10-23','http://books.google.com/books?id=oCXLwr8NIPIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=robert+harris+the+ghost&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oCXLwr8NIPIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','oCXLwr8NIPIC','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(261,'Pompeii','BESTSELLER - \"Terrific... gripping... A literally shattering climax.\" -- The New York Times Book Review All along the Mediterranean coast, the Roman empire’s richest citizens are relaxing in their luxurious villas, enjoying the last days of summer. The world’s largest navy lies peacefully at anchor in Misenum. The tourists are spending their money in the seaside resorts of Baiae, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. But the carefree lifestyle and gorgeous weather belie an impending cataclysm, and only one man is worried. The young engineer Marcus Attilius Primus has just taken charge of the Aqua Augusta, the enormous aqueduct that brings fresh water to a quarter of a million people in nine towns around the Bay of Naples. His predecessor has disappeared. Springs are failing for the first time in generations. And now there is a crisis on the Augusta’ s sixty-mile main line—somewhere to the north of Pompeii, on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. Attilius—decent, practical, and incorruptible—promises Pliny, the famous scholar who commands the navy, that he can repair the aqueduct before the reservoir runs dry. His plan is to travel to Pompeii and put together an expedition, then head out to the place where he believes the fault lies. But Pompeii proves to be a corrupt and violent town, and Attilius soon discovers that there are powerful forces at work—both natural and man-made—threatening to destroy him. With his trademark elegance and intelligence, Robert Harris, bestselling author of Archangel and Fatherland, re-creates a world on the brink of disaster.','Random House Trade Paperbacks','2005-11-08','http://books.google.com/books?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&dq=robert+harris+pompeii&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=brlPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','brlPEAAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,NULL),(262,'Cliffs Notes on Hawthorne\'s The Scarlet Letter','The original CliffsNotes study guides offer expert commentary on major themes, plots, characters, literary devices, and historical background.

This long-awaited new edition of Lattimore\'s Iliad is designed to bring the book into the twenty-first century—while leaving the poem as firmly rooted in ancient Greece as ever. Lattimore\'s elegant, fluent verses—with their memorably phrased heroic epithets and remarkable fidelity to the Greek—remain unchanged, but classicist Richard Martin has added a wealth of supplementary materials designed to aid new generations of readers. A new introduction sets the poem in the wider context of Greek life, warfare, society, and poetry, while line-by-line notes at the back of the volume offer explanations of unfamiliar terms, information about the Greek gods and heroes, and literary appreciation. A glossary and maps round out the book. The result is a volume that actively invites readers into Homer\'s poem, helping them to understand fully the worlds in which he and his heroes lived—and thus enabling them to marvel, as so many have for centuries, at Hektor and Ajax, Paris and Helen, and the devastating rage of Achilleus.','University of Chicago Press','2011-09-19','http://books.google.com/books?id=VppP9t9CjFIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+iliad+of+homer+lattimore&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VppP9t9CjFIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','VppP9t9CjFIC','PH',NULL,1,2),(289,'The Odyssey','Penelope has been waiting for her husband Odysseus to return from Troy for many years.

Edited by his son Patrick, who accompanied his father on the safari, True at First Light offers rare insights into the legendary American writer. A blend of autobiography and fiction, the book opens on the day his close friend Pop, a celebrated hunter, leaves Ernest in charge of the safari camp and news arrives of a potential attack from a hostile tribe. Drama continues to build as his wife, Mary pursues the great black–maned lion that has become her obsession. Spicing his depictions of human longings with sharp humor, Hemingway captures the excitement of big-game hunting and the unparalleled beauty of the scenery—the green plains covered with gray mist, zebra and gazelle traversing the horizon, cool dark nights broken by the sounds of the hyena\'s cry. As the group at camp help Mary track her prize, she and Ernest suffer the “incalculable casualties of marriage,” and their attempts to love each other well are marred by cruelty, competition and infidelity. Ernest has become involved with Debba, an African girl whom he supposedly plans to take as a second bride. Increasingly enchanted by the local African community, he struggles between the attraction of these two women and the wildly different cultures they represent. In True at First Light, Hemingway also chronicles his exploits—sometimes hilarious and sometimes poignant—among the African men with whom he has become very close, reminisces about encounters with other writers and his days in Paris and Spain and satirizes, among other things, the role of organized religion in Africa. He also muses on the act of writing itself and the author\'s role in determining the truth. What is fact and what is fiction? This is a question that was posed by Hemingway\'s readers throughout his career and is one of his principal subjects here. Equally adept at evoking the singular textures of the landscape, the thrill of the hunt and the complexities of married life, Hemingway weaves a tale that is rich in laughter, beauty and profound insight. True at First Light is an extraordinary publishing event—a breathtaking final work from one of this nation\'s most beloved and important writers.','Simon and Schuster','2014-05-22','http://books.google.com/books?id=OdBQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=true+at+first+light+hemingway&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OdBQAQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','OdBQAQAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(297,'By-line: Ernest Hemingway; Selected Articles and Dispatches Four Decades.

The intelligent and outspoken child of radical Marxists, and the great-grandaughter of Iran\'s last emperor, Satrapi bears witness to a childhood uniquely entwined with the history of her country. Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering contradictions between home life and public life. Amidst the tragedy, Marjane\'s child\'s eye view adds immediacy and humour, and her story of a childhood at once outrageous and ordinary, beset by the unthinkable and yet buffered by an extraordinary and loving family, is immensely moving.

The chase even leads them to the underworld, where the characters’ alter egos discuss questions of human nature and philosophy in a lively debate in a scene often performed separately as “Don Juan in Hell.” In Man and Superman, Shaw combined seriousness with comedy to create a satirical and buoyant exposé of the eternal struggle between the sexes. This is the definitive text produced under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence.

Before Garrison Keillor and Spalding Gray there was Jean Shepherd: a master monologist and writer who spun the materials of his all-American childhood into immensely resonant--and utterly hilarious--works of comic art. In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash represents one of the peaks of his achievement, a compound of irony, affection, and perfect detail that speaks across generations. In God We Trust, Shepherd\'s wildly witty reunion with his Indiana hometown, disproves the adage \"You can never go back.\" Bending the ear of Flick, his childhood-buddy-turned-bartender, Shepherd recalls passionately his genuine Red Ryder BB gun, confesses adolescent failure in the arms of Junie Jo Prewitt, and relives a story of man against fish that not even Hemingway could rival. From pop art to the World\'s Fair, Shepherd\'s subjects speak with a universal irony and are deeply and unabashedly grounded in American Midwestern life, together rendering a wonderfully nostalgic impression of a more innocent era when life was good, fun was clean, and station wagons roamed the earth. A comic genius who bridged the gap between James Thurber and David Sedaris, Shepherd may have accomplished for Holden, Indiana, what Mark Twain did for Hannibal, Missouri.','Crown','2010-10-27','http://books.google.com/books?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=in+god+we+trust+shepherd&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','cHpM9jx9roIC','PH',NULL,1,2),(326,'Wanda Hickey\'s Night of Golden Memories','The popular radio announcer uses his whimsical imagination to record the events of his Indiana boyhood','Broadway Books','1971-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_ZvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=wanda+hickey%27s+night+of+golden+memories+shepherd&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Q_ZvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','Q_ZvDwAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(327,'The Tale of Genji','An abridged edition of the world’s first novel, in a translation that is “likely to be the definitive edition . . . for many years to come” (The Wall Street Journal) The inspiration behind The Metropolitan Museum of Art\'s \"The Tale of Genji: A Japanese Classic Illuminated\" -- Now through June 16 at The Met Fifth Avenue A Penguin Classic Written in the eleventh century, this exquisite portrait of courtly life in medieval Japan is widely celebrated as the world’s first novel—and is certainly one of its finest.

In German-occupied East Africa during World War I, British forces have arrived. In defiance of his orders, German military commander Paul von Lettow enlists soldiers, civilians, and African rebels to fight against the British, forming the first modern guerrilla uprising of the time. Amid his political battles, Lettow is embroiled in a romantic relationship with an American woman who loves him, but who objects to his war. To complicate things, Lettow’s actions draw the attention of the brilliant but brutal chief of British intelligence who plots to defeat him. Amid all the action, Zionists fight for influence in the region, rival tribes have to be appeased with diplomacy, and an African princess serves as a spy for the rebels. Amazingly, these colorful characters and eventful plots are firmly based on real-life personas and historical events during the war. In the gripping style of narrative fiction, Stevenson relates the often overlooked German resistance in East Africa and their inventive use of guerrilla tactics. As a former foreign correspondent in the region, Stevenson paints an astonishingly accurate and detailed picture of the geography and political climate of East Africa. A thrilling read, The Ghosts of Africa packs history, military tactics, romance, and adventure into a single epic tale that will both entertain and inform.

Included here are the O.

An unlikely pair, George and Lennie, two migrant workers in California during the Great Depression, grasp for their American Dream. They hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations, nor predict the consequences of Lennie\'s unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. Of Mice and Men represents an experiment in form, which Steinbeck described as “a kind of playable novel, written in a novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.” A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.

Unlike most coming-of-age stories, the cycle does not end with a hero “matured” by circumstances. As John Seelye writes in his introduction, reversing common interpretations, The Red Pony is imbued with a sense of loss. Jody’s encounters with birth and death express a common theme in Steinbeck’s fiction: They are parts of the ongoing process of life, “resolving” nothing. The Red Pony was central not only to Steinbeck’s emergence as a major American novelist but to the shaping of a distinctly mid twentieth-century genre, opening up a new range of possibilities about the fictional presence of a child’s world.

Out of their trials and their repeated collisions against the hard realities of an America divided into haves and have-nots evolves a drama that is intensely human yet majestic in its scale and moral vision, elemental yet plainspoken, tragic but ultimately stirring in its human dignity. A portrait of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless, of one man’s fierce reaction to injustice, and of one woman’s stoical strength, the novel captures the horrors of the Great Depression and probes the very nature of equality and justice in America. As Don DeLillo has claimed, Steinbeck “shaped a geography of conscience” with this novel where “there is something at stake in every sentence.” Beyond that—for emotional urgency, evocative power, sustained impact, prophetic reach, and continued controversy—The Grapes of Wrath is perhaps the most American of American classics.

Sixty years ago, the University of Chicago Press undertook a momentous project: a new translation of the Greek tragedies that would be the ultimate resource for teachers, students, and readers. They succeeded. Under the expert management of eminent classicists David Grene and Richmond Lattimore, those translations combined accuracy, poetic immediacy, and clarity of presentation to render the surviving masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides in an English so lively and compelling that they remain the standard translations. Today, Chicago is taking pains to ensure that our Greek tragedies remain the leading English-language versions throughout the twenty-first century. In this highly anticipated third edition, Mark Griffith and Glenn W. Most have carefully updated the translations to bring them even closer to the ancient Greek while retaining the vibrancy for which our English versions are famous. This edition also includes brand-new translations of Euripides’ Medea, The Children of Heracles, Andromache, and Iphigenia among the Taurians, fragments of lost plays by Aeschylus, and the surviving portion of Sophocles’s satyr-drama The Trackers. New introductions for each play offer essential information about its first production, plot, and reception in antiquity and beyond. In addition, each volume includes an introduction to the life and work of its tragedian, as well as notes addressing textual uncertainties and a glossary of names and places mentioned in the plays. In addition to the new content, the volumes have been reorganized both within and between volumes to reflect the most up-to-date scholarship on the order in which the plays were originally written. The result is a set of handsome paperbacks destined to introduce new generations of readers to these foundational works of Western drama, art, and life.','University of Chicago Press','2013-04-19','http://books.google.com/books?id=dcBrvgAACAAJ&dq=sophocles+II+grene&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dcBrvgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','dcBrvgAACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(348,'Oedipus Tyrannus','Not Present','Norton Critical Edition','1970-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=kRTRjwEACAAJ&dq=oedipus+trannus+sophocles+berkowitz&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','https://i.imgur.com/fnVKr.gif','kRTRjwEACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(349,'The Rebel','By one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of our century, The Rebel is a classic essay on revolution.

But Agnes’s enthusiasm is swiftly extinguished as she struggles first with the unmanageable Bloomfield children and then with the painful disdain of the haughty Murray family; the only kindness she receives comes from Mr Weston, the sober young curate. Drawing on her own experience, Anne Brontë’s first novel offers a compelling personal perspective on the desperate position of unmarried, educated women for whom becoming a governess was the only respectable career open in Victorian society. This edition also includes Charlotte Brontë’s memoir of her sisters, theBiographical Notice of Ellis and Acton Bell.

He is quick to offer Helen his friendship, but when her reclusive behaviour becomes the subject of local gossip and speculation, Gilbert begins to wonder whether his trust in her has been misplaced. It is only when she allows Gilbert to read her diary that the truth is revealed and the shocking details of the disastrous marriage she has left behind emerge. Told with great immediacy, combined with wit and irony, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a powerful depiction of a woman\'s fight for domestic independence and creative freedom.

Absolutely and most vividly original.”—Saturday Review The seventeen pieces in Ficciones demonstrate the gargantuan powers of imagination, intelligence, and style of one of the greatest writers of this or any other century. Borges sends us on a journey into a compelling, bizarre, and profoundly resonant realm; we enter the fearful sphere of Pascal’s abyss, the surreal and literal labyrinth of books, and the iconography of eternal return. More playful and approachable than the fictions themselves are Borges’s Prologues, brief elucidations that offer the uninitiated a passageway into the whirlwind of Borges’s genius and mirror the precision and potency of his intellect and inventiveness, his piercing irony, his skepticism, and his obsession with fantasy. To enter the worlds in Ficciones is to enter the mind of Jorge Luis Borges, wherein lies Heaven, Hell, and everything in between.','Grove/Atlantic, Inc.','2015-05-12','http://books.google.com/books?id=E1SCCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=ficciones+borges&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=E1SCCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','E1SCCgAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(360,'The Consolation of Philosophy','Boethius was an eminent public figure under the Gothic emperor Theodoric, and an exceptional Greek scholar.

As Clive Barnes wrote, “Time catches up with genius … Waiting for Godot is one of the masterpieces of the century.” The story revolves around two seemingly homeless men waiting for someone—or something—named Godot. Vladimir and Estragon wait near a tree, inhabiting a drama spun of their own consciousness. The result is a comical wordplay of poetry, dreamscapes, and nonsense, which has been interpreted as mankind’s inexhaustible search for meaning.

Now Chandler joins the authoritative Library of America series in a comprehensive two-volume set displaying all the facets of his brilliant talent. In his first novel, The Big Sleep (1939), the classic private eye finds his full-fledged form as Philip Marlowe: at once tough, independent, brash, disillusioned, and sensitive—and man of weary honor threading his way (in Chandler’s phrase) “down these mean streets” among blackmailers, pornographers, and murderers for hire. In Farewell, My Lovely (1940), Chandler’s personal favorite among his novels, Marlowe’s search for a missing woman leads him from shanties and honky-tonks to the highest reaches of power, encountering an array of richly drawn characters. The High Window (1942), about a rare coin that becomes a catalyst by which a hushed-up crime comes back to haunt a wealthy family, is partly a humorous burlesque of pulp fiction. All three novels show Chandler at a peak of verbal inventiveness and storytelling drive Stories and Early Novels also includes every classic noir story from the 1930s that Chandler did not later incorporate into a novel—thirteen in all, among them such classics as “Red Wind,” “Finger Man,” The King in Yellow,\" and “Trouble Is My Business.” Drawn from the pages of Black Mask and Dime Detective, these stories show how Chandler adapted the violent conventions of the pulp magazine—with their brisk exposition and rapid-fire dialogue—to his own emerging vision of twentieth-century America. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.','Library of America','1995-10-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=o6hNEAAAQBAJ&dq=chandler+stories+%26+early+novels&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=o6hNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','o6hNEAAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(377,'Raymond Chandler: Later Novels and Other Writings (LOA #80)','Later Novels and Other Writings begins with The Lady in the Lake (1943). Written during the war, the story takes Marlowe out of the seamy L.A. streets to the deceptive tranquility of the surrounding mountains, as the search for a businessman\'s missing wife expands into an elegy of loneliness and loss. The darker tone typical of Chandler\'s later fiction is evident in The Little Sister (1949), in which an ambitious starlet, a blackmailer, and a seemingly naive young woman from Manhattan, Kansas, are the key players in a plot that provides fuel for a bitter indictment of Hollywood and Chandler\'s most savage portrayal of his adopted city. The Long Goodbye (1953), his most ambitious and self-revealing novel, uncovers a more anguished resonance in the Marlowe character, in a plot that hinges on the betrayal of friendship and the compromises of middle age. Playback (1958), written originally as a screenplay, is Chandler\'s seventh and last novel. A special feature of this volume is Chandler\'s long-unavailable screenplay for the film noir classic Double Indemnity (1944), adapted from James M. Cain\'s novel. Supplementing the volume, and providing a more personal glimpse of Chandler\'s personality, are a selection of essays - including \"The Simple Art of Murder,\" in which Chandler muses on his pulp roots and on the special qualities of his hero and style - and eleven letters that range wittily and often sardonically over the worlds of writing, publishing, and filmmaking.','Not Present','1995-10-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=TmWuAAAAIAAJ&q=chandler+later+novels+%26+other+writings&dq=chandler+later+novels+%26+other+writings&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=TmWuAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','TmWuAAAAIAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(378,'Selected works of Cicero','Not Present','Not Present','1948-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=-PUYMQAACAAJ&dq=selected+works+cicero+hubbell&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','https://i.imgur.com/fnVKr.gif','-PUYMQAACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(379,'On Old Age.

In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, most people believe magic to have long since disappeared from England - until the reclusive Mr. Norrell reveals his powers and becomes an overnight celebrity. Another practicing magician then emerges: the young and daring Jonathan Strange. He becomes Norrell\'s pupil, and the two join forces in the war against France. But Strange is increasingly drawn to the wild, most perilous forms of magic, and he soon risks sacrificing his partnership with Norrell and everything else he holds dear. Susanna Clarke\'s brilliant first novel is an utterly compelling epic tale of nineteenth-century England and the two magicians who, first as teacher and pupil and then as rivals, emerge to change its history.','Bloomsbury Publishing USA','2010-06-05','http://books.google.com/books?id=i_-bdQjbAZ8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=jonathan+strange+%26+mr+norrell+clarke&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=i_-bdQjbAZ8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','i_-bdQjbAZ8C','PH',NULL,1,2),(385,'The Waste Land and Other Poems','A Vintage Classics edition of T.

As with \"April is the cruelest month,\" from The Waste Land and \"Do I dare disturb the universe?,\" from \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,\" Eliot\'s words have permanently entered our cultural bloodstream. Through the poems in this volume, representing his first four published collections, Eliot reshaped modern literature with a daring and overpowering vision of a decaying civilization and the urgent need for spiritual renewal.','Vintage','2021-05-11','http://books.google.com/books?id=J78qEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=T.+S.+eliot+the+waste+land+and+other+poems&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J78qEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','J78qEAAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(386,'Murder in the Cathedral','The verse dramatization of the medieval murder of Thomas Becket at Canterbury by the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

As she grows older, Maggie\'s discovery of romantic love draws her once more into a struggle to reconcile familial and moral claims with her own desires. Strong-willed, compassionate, and intensely loyal, Maggie seeks personal happiness and inner peace but risks rejection and ostracism in her close-knit community. Opening with one of the most powerful fictional evocations of childhood, The Mill on the Floss (1860) vividly portrays both the \'oppressive narrowness\' and the appeal of provincial England, the comedy as well as the tragedy of obscure lives. George Eliot\'s most autobiographical novel was also her most controversial, and has been the subject of animated debate ever since.

It is Christmas Eve, 1957, and there are cozier places to be than the cockpit of a de Havilland Vampire fighter plane. But for the Royal Air Force pilot who has just taken off from West Germany, this single-seat jet is the only way to make it back to England for Christmas morning. His flight plan is simple; the fuel tank is full. In sixty-six minutes, he will be back in Blighty. But then the plane begins to fail. First the compass goes haywire, then the radio dies. Lost and alone above the English coast, the pilot is searching for a landing strip when the fog closes in, signaling certain death. He has given up hope when a second shadow appears—a Mosquito fighter-bomber of World War II vintage. The plane is a “shepherd,” guiding the Vampire to a safe landing, and its appearance is a gift from fate, a miracle out of time—but for one lonely pilot, the mystery has just begun.

They carry with them everything they believe they will need from home, but soon find that all of it—from garden seeds to Scripture—is calamitously transformed on African soil. What follows is a suspenseful epic of one family’s tragic undoing and remarkable reconstruction over the course of three decades in postcolonial Africa. The novel is set against one of the most dramatic political chronicles of the twentieth century: the Congo\'s fight for independence from Belgium, the murder of its first elected prime minister, the CIA coup to install his replacement, and the insidious progress of a world economic order that robs the fledgling African nation of its autonomy.

Berlin, 1945. Jake Geismar, former Berlin correspondent for CBS, has managed to wangle one of the coveted press slots for the Potsdam Conference. His assignment: a series of articles on the American occupation of postwar Berlin. His personal agenda: to find Lena, the German mistress he left behind at the outbreak of the war. When he stumbles on a murder--an American soldier washed up on the shore of the conference grounds--he thinks he has found the key that will unlock his Berlin story. What he finds instead is a larger story of corruption and intrigue reaching deep into the heart of the occupation and a city not only physically but morally devastatated, where children scavenge for food in the rubble, sex can be had for a cigarette, and the black market is the only means of survival. Berlin at zero hour is like nowhere else--a tragedy, and a feverish party after the end of the world. And nothing is simple--not the murder of a soldier and not any of the lives, American and German, that Jake encounters as he tries to solve it. More unsolvable still is the larger crime that hangs over everything in 1945, a crime so huge it seems beyond punishment.

Lowrie\'s translation, first published in 1941 and later revised, was the first in English, and it has introduced hundreds of thousands of readers to Kierkegaard\'s thought. Kierkegaard counted Fear and Trembling and The Sickness Unto Death among \"the most perfect books I have written,\" and in them he introduces two terms--\"the absurd\" and \"despair\"--that have become key terms in modern thought. Fear and Trembling takes up the story of Abraham and Isaac to explore a faith that transcends the ethical, persists in the face of the absurd, and meets its reward in the return of all that the faithful one is willing to sacrifice, while The Sickness Unto Death examines the spiritual anxiety of despair. Walter Lowrie\'s magnificent translation of these seminal works continues to provide an ideal introduction to Kierkegaard.

In doing so, it provides an oblique self-portrait of the young Joyce himself. At its center lie questions of origin and source, authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in style, the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero’s quest to create his own character, his own language, life, and art: “to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.” This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, published for the novel’s centennial, is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author’s original wishes.

The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche\'s first book. Its youthful faults were exposed by Nietzsche in the brilliant \"Attempt at a Self-Criticism\" which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down through the Victorian era, and it sounded themes developed in the twentieth century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts, and others. The Case of Wagner (1888) was one Nietzsche\'s last books, and his wittiest. In attitude and style it is diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects and deal with art and culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche\'s thought.

Based on historical people and real events, Miller\'s drama is a searing portrait of a community engulfed by hysteria. In the rigid theocracy of Salem, rumors that women are practicing witchcraft galvanize the town\'s most basic fears and suspicions; and when a young girl accuses Elizabeth Proctor of being a witch, self-righteous church leaders and townspeople insist that Elizabeth be brought to trial. The ruthlessness of the prosecutors and the eagerness of neighbor to testify against neighbor brilliantly illuminate the destructive power of socially sanctioned violence. Written in 1953, The Crucible is a mirror Miller uses to reflect the anti-communist hysteria inspired by Senator Joseph McCarthy\'s \"witch-hunts\" in the United States. Within the text itself, Miller contemplates the parallels, writing: \"Political opposition...is given an inhumane overlay, which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied customs of civilized behavior. A political policy is equated with moral right, and opposition to it with diabolical malevolence.\" For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It is, above all, a way of asserting power.”—The New Yorker In 1984, London is a grim city in the totalitarian state of Oceania where Big Brother is always watching you and the Thought Police can practically read your mind. Winston Smith is a man in grave danger for the simple reason that his memory still functions. Drawn into a forbidden love affair, Winston finds the courage to join a secret revolutionary organization called The Brotherhood, dedicated to the destruction of the Party. Together with his beloved Julia, he hazards his life in a deadly match against the powers that be. Lionel Trilling said of Orwell’s masterpiece, “1984 is a profound, terrifying, and wholly fascinating book. It is a fantasy of the political future, and like any such fantasy, serves its author as a magnifying device for an examination of the present.” Though the year 1984 now exists in the past, Orwell’s novel remains an urgent call for the individual willing to speak truth to power.','HarperCollins','2013-09-03','http://books.google.com/books?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=orwell+1984&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=kotPYEqx7kMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','kotPYEqx7kMC','PH',NULL,1,2),(480,'Scarlet Pimpernel The','Every step the Scarlet Pimpernel takes on French soil is fraught with danger\' The French Terror is raging, and few are safe from the threat of the guillotine.

Nietzsche\'s notebooks, kept by him during his most productive years, offer a fascinating glimpse into the workshop and mind of a great thinker, and compare favorably with the notebooks of Gide and Kafka, Camus and Wittgenstein. The Will to Power, compiled from the notebooks, is one of the most famous boooks of the philosophy. Here is the first critical edition in any language. Down through the Nazi period The Will to Power was often mistakenly considered to be Nietzche\'s crowning systematic labor; since World War II it has frequently been denigrated. In fact, it represents a stunning selection from Nietzsche\'s notebooks, in a a topical arrangement that enables the reader to find what Nietzsche\'s wrote on a variety of subjects. Walter Kaufmann, in collaboration with R. J. Holilngdale, brings to this volume his unsurpassed skills as a Nietzsche translator and scholar. Professor Kaufmann has included an approximate date of each note. His running footnote commentary offers information needed to follow Nietzsche\'s train of thought, and indicates, among other things, which notes were eventually superseded by later formulations.

The Apology is both a robust rebuttal to the charges of impiety and corrupting young minds and a definitive defence of the philosopher\'s life. Later, condemned and imprisoned in the Crito, Socrates counters the arguments of friends urging him to escape. And finally, in the Phaedo , Plato shows him calmly confident in the face of death, skilfully arguing the case for the immortality of the soul.

Although Plato\'s views that citizens should act in complete obedience to the law have been read as totalitarian, the Laws nonetheless constitutes a highly impressive programme for the reform of society and provides a crucial insight into the mind of one of Classical Greece\'s foremost thinkers.','Penguin UK','2005-01-27','http://books.google.com/books?id=UFfn9cOhFBkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=plato+the+laws+penguin&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UFfn9cOhFBkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','UFfn9cOhFBkC','PH',NULL,1,2),(500,'The Satyricon of Petronius ; Translated with an Introduction by William Arrowsmith','Not Present','Not Present','1959-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=8OD_cQAACAAJ&dq=petronius+the+satyricon+arrowsmith&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','https://i.imgur.com/fnVKr.gif','8OD_cQAACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(501,'Doctor Zhivago','On they went singing \'Eternal Memory\', and whenever they stopped, the sound of their feet, the horses and the gusts of wind seemed to carry on their singing ...Doctor Zhivago is the epic novel of Russia in the throes of revolution and one of the greatest love stories ever told.

In 1949 four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. United in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. \"To despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable.\" Forty years later the stories and history continue. With wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties.

Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel\'s seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy\'s writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice.

Twain\'s Debt to the burlesque styling of regional humorists and his celebrated gift for accurately rendering regional speech are never more in evidence than here, but as Hamlin Hill points out in his introduction, Roughing It must also be read as Twain\'s renunciation of his footloose bachelorhood, his rejection of the mythic, romanticized image of the West, and his autopsy of the American dream.

Born in Marylebone, London in 1824, Collins\' family enrolled him at the Maida Hill Academy in 1835, but then took him to France and Italy with them between 1836 and 1838. Returning to England, Collins attended Cole\'s boarding school, and completed his education in 1841, after which he was apprenticed to the tea merchants Antrobus & Co. in the Strand. In 1846, Collins became a law student at Lincoln\'s Inn, and was called to the bar in 1851, although he never practiced. It was in 1848, a year after the death of his father, that he published his first book, The Memoirs of the Life of William Collins, Esq., R.A., to good reviews. The 1860s saw Collins\' creative high-point, and it was during this decade that he achieved fame and critical acclaim, with his four major novels, The Woman in White (1860), No Name (1862), Armadale (1866) and The Moonstone (1868). The Moonstone, meanwhile is seen by many as the first true detective novel - T. S. Eliot called it \"the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels...in a genre invented by Collins and not by Poe.\" Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900\'s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

Written in the aftermath of Antonina (1850), his successful debut, The Dead Secret finds the author honing the trademark sense of mystery and psychological unease that would make him a household name around the world. Recognized as an important Victorian novelist and pioneer of detective fiction, Wilkie Collins was a writer with a gift for thoughtful entertainment, stories written for a popular audience that continue to resonate with scholars and readers today. Born in Porthgenna Tower, Rosamond Treverton is a child of secrecy. Her birthmother, Sarah Leeson, became pregnant after an affair with a local miner. Unable to raise her daughter, she allowed her to be adopted by Mrs. Treverton, the lady of the Tower, herself unable to bear children. Sworn to silence, Sarah leaves a hidden note in a room at Porthgenna before disappearing into the night. Years later, the Tower has been inherited by Rosamond, who continues to live there with her husband Leonard Frankland. When she becomes pregnant, a strange nurse arrives to take care of her and soon reveals the secret of her birth, threatening Rosamond’s control of Porthgenna Tower and the Treverton family fortune. Beyond its sensational plot, The Dead Secret is a masterpiece of Gothic suspense and mystery for seasoned readers of Victorian fiction and newcomers alike. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Wilkie Collins’ The Dead Secret is a classic work of English literature reimagined for modern readers.','Graphic Arts Books','2021-05-21','http://books.google.com/books?id=VW8vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=collins+the+dead+secret&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VW8vEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','VW8vEAAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(544,'Blind Love','Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive.

Officers and enlisted men, all prisoners together, yet the old hierarchies and rivalries survive. An American corporal, known as the King, has used his personality and wiles to facilitate trading with guards and locals to get needed food, supplies, even information into the camp. The imprisoned upper-class officers have never had to do things for themselves, and now they are reduced to wearing rags while the King’s clean shirt, gained through guts and moxie, seems like luxury in comparison. In the camp, everything has its price and everything is for sale. But trading is illegal—and the King has made a formidable enemy. Robin Grey, the provost marshal, hates the King and all he represents. Grey, though he grew up modestly, fervently believes in the British class system: everyone should know their place, and he knows the King’s place is at the bottom. The King does have a friend in Peter Marlowe, who, though wary of the King and himself a product of the British system, finds himself drawn to the charismatic man who just might be the only one who can save them from both the inhumanity of the prison camp but also from themselves. Powerful and engrossing, King Rat artfully weaves the author’s own World War II prison camp experiences into a compelling narrative of survival amidst the grim realities of war and what men can do when pushed to the edge.

He is now the Tai-Pan—Supreme Leader—of all Tai-Pans in China. Along the way, however, he made a powerful enemy. Tyler Brock, Struan’s rival from their early opium-smuggling days, also heads a large trading fleet, second in size only to Struan’s. But it is not only silks and spices that drive their mutual companies’ wealth—the opium trade is still booming. War between England and China might be over, but the hostilities remain. Struan and Brock come to control much of England’s trade with China yet neither can control their desires or their hatred of each other. Over the years, their two families will cross paths, threatening to rip both apart, with reverberations that will echo across the generations. Struan must fight to save his company and his family, or risk seeing everything he has created destroyed at the hands of his sworn enemy. Ambition, political intrigue, and love and lust weave their way throughout the novel the New York Times called, “grand entertainment...packed with action...with blood and sin, treachery and conspiracy, sex and murder.” East and West come together in an opulent and intricately plotted narrative.

As Malcolm Struan, the son of Culum and Tess Struan, and a small band of Westerners travel down the Tōkaidō road, they are attacked by two Satsuma samurai, who mortally wound John Canterbury and seriously injure Malcolm, who then finds reprieve in the merchant village of Yokohama after a narrow escape facilitated by the unscathed Angelique.

The country, once secular, is now thrown back into an orthodoxy that threatens to tear it apart. The United States and Russia go on high alert, with warships heading to the Middle East. The region becomes a powder keg, waiting to explode. Caught up in the revolution are a British helicopter company and its pilots. The oil fields of Iran need helicopters to ferry workers and administrators, and when the main US aviation company pulls out of Iran fearing what might come next, S-G Helicopters steps in to fill the void. Soon they realize that they, too, must leave or risk losing all their machines to whomever takes control of the country. The company risks bankruptcy if that happens—which would ruin Andrew Gallavan and reveal that the company is actually owned by a secret Hong Kong–based consortium: Noble House, controlled by the Struan family. Caught in between is his son, Scot, a pilot in Iran who must help save his father’s company, but also the other pilots and their families. In a risky move, the pilots concoct a plan to get their choppers out of Iran. But will they be able to escape a country crumbling around them before it’s too late?

It was a bird’s-eye view of America—and the trip of a lifetime for author Stephen Coonts and his fourteen-year-old son. But even for Coonts, who had clocked 1,600 hours as a naval aviator and was the recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross commendation, this was a first. He’d be flying closer to the earth than he ever had before. His big yellow wood-and-canvas bird was the Cannibal Queen, a Stearman open-cockpit biplane built in 1942. Destined for the scrap yard, it was rescued and restored for what Coonts would call his “Stearman summer.” On a clear June afternoon in 1991, Coonts and his son took off to see the country the same way the barnstormers flew their Jennys: with a map and a compass. Coonts followed highways, railroad lines, back roads, mountains, rivers, and landmarks. For the next three months, seeing old friends and meeting new ones, he touched down on the diverse landscapes of each of the forty-eight contiguous states to record the stories of the American countryside, its spirited people, and its rich history. Soaring from big cities to the heartland, experiencing everything from Bourbon Street jazz and small-town barbershop quartets to greasy spoons and backyard barbeques, the author of Flight of the Intruder and The Art of War captures not only the singular thrill of biplane aviation, but a nostalgia for the simple pleasures of an America thought lost and forgotten. Stephen Coonts found it, and in The Cannibal Queen he shares every exultant moment.

As a visionary, he dared draw maps of Hell, with Purgatory and Paradise, and populate all three realms with recognizable human beings. As a passionate lover, he became a poet of bereavement and renunication. As all of these, Dante Alighieri paved the way for modern literature, while creating verse and prose that remain unparalleled for formal elegance, intellectual depth, and emotional grandeur.

As churches are razed, icons are banned, and the price of devotion is execution, an unnamed member of the clergy flees. He’s known only as the “whisky priest.” Beset by heretical vices, guilt, and an immoral past, he’s torn between self-destruction and self-preservation.

Salinger\'s The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature. William Golding\'s compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories—and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible.Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic. \"Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books.

S. T. Joshi, Lovecraft\'s preeminent interpreter, presents a selection of the master\'s fiction, from the early tales of nightmares and madness such as \"The Outsider\" to the overpowering cosmic terror of \"The Call of Cthulhu.\" More than just a collection of terrifying tales, this volume reveals the development of Lovecraft\'s mesmerizing narrative style and establishes him as a canonical - and visionary - American writer.

Included here are some of del Toro’s favorites, from Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Ray Russell’s short story “Sardonicus,” considered by Stephen King to be “perhaps the finest example of the modern Gothic ever written,” to Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House and stories by Ray Bradbury, Joyce Carol Oates, Ted Klein, and Robert E.

The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories Howard Phillips Lovecraft\'s unique contribution to American literature was a melding of traditional supernaturalism (derived chiefly from Edgar Allan Poe) with the genre of science fiction that emerged in the early 1920s. The Thing on the Doorstep and Other Weird Stories brings together a dozen of the master\'s tales—from his early short stories \"Under the Pyramids\" (originally ghostwritten for Harry Houdini) and “The Music of Erich Zann” (which Lovecraft ranked second among his own favorites) through his more fully developed works, “The Dunwich Horror,” “The Case of Charles Dexter Ward,” and “At the Mountains of Madness.” The book presents the definitive corrected texts of these works, along with Lovecraft critic and biographer S.

It features literary phenomena with influence and themes so great that, after their publication, they changed literature forever. From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the striking personal narrative of Harriet Jacobs in Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our history through the words of the exceptional few. Jack London’s The Call of the Wild and White Fang are both adventure stories featuring animal protagonists—a sled dog named Buck and the appropriately named White Fang. Partially told from the perspective of the dogs, these stories gave London the opportunity to explore and predict how animals perceive our world. Buck was Judge Miller’s pet and lived happily in Santa Clara Valley, California. Until one day, when he’s kidnapped by the gardener’s assistant and sold to traders. Eventually he ends up in the Klondike region of Canada, where he is trained to become a sled dog. After he witnesses a fellow sled dog killed by a pack of huskies, Buck starts to shed his domesticated habits and embrace his primordial instincts in order to survive. White Fang, in a similar vein, tells the tale of another canine—a young gray wolf cub who is the strongest of his litter. As he grows, White Fang begins to understand the nature of the wilderness—that it is survival of the fittest: “The aim of life was meat. Life itself was meat. Life lived on life. There were the eaters and the eaten. The law was: EAT OR BE EATEN.” After wandering into an Indian camp, losing his mother, being severely beaten, and being forced into dog-fighting, his life is forever changed as he struggles to find his place in the animal kingdom. In these classic novels, London explores the remarkable relationship between man and beast.','Simon and Schuster','2016-05-17','http://books.google.com/books?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=london+white+fang+and+the+call+of+the+wild&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','dzKCDwAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(631,'The Russia House','World powers clash for dominance as a beautiful Russian woman carries out a staggering mission and a derelict English publisher becomes the unlikely recipient of the Soviet Union\'s top defense secret.

El Capitan was their holy grail, and their destiny seemed written on its big walls. Here they met the women who married, then left them. Hugh\'s wife mysteriously disappeared into the desert. Lewis\'s wife is divorcing him. Now, the old friends reunite to climb El Cap one last time and make a fresh start. But \"the Captain\" seems cursed this time around. Even before the aging \"wall rats\" leave the ground, disaster strikes three young women high on a neighboring route. Hugh discovers one body in the forest and spies a second dangling a half mile overhead. He and Lewis launch their ascent, desperate to leave the terrible omens behind. But there is no escape. Doubts haunt them, the elements plague them, and an eerie reptilian woman invades their sleep. Nothing comes free up here. Every vertical inch, the men must battle the stone, their aging bodies, fear, and the memories of great loves lost. They doggedly climb on, only to be drawn into a deadly rescue attempt by Augustine, a search-and-rescue expert. Like a man possessed, he is hell-bent on saving his lover, one of the doomed women. Hugh ties in to the rope with him and climbs through a gauntlet of fire, ice, and deep gravity to the wreckage of the fall. There, he and Augustine find a survivor, starved, half-mad, and holding a corpse. The battered young woman raves that El Cap requires one final sacrifice.

It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buendía family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America. Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel García Márquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.

Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1900, when Mann was only twenty-five, has become a classic of modem literature -- the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany. With consummate skill, Mann draws a rounded picture of middle-class life: births and christenings; marriages, divorces, and deaths; successes and failures. These commonplace occurrences, intrinsically the same, vary slightly as they recur in each succeeding generation. Yet as the Buddenbrooks family eventually succumbs to the seductions of modernity -- seductions that are at variance with its own traditions -- its downfall becomes certain. In immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, Buddenbrooks surpasses all other modem family chronicles; it has, indeed, proved a model for most of them.

Winner of the National Book Award for Marcel Proust, a sweeping examination of Proust\'s life and works, Shattuck now offers a useful and eminently readable guidebook to Proust\'s epic masterpiece, and a contemplation of memory and consciousness throughout great literature. Here, Shattuck laments Proust\'s defenselessness against zealous editors, praises some translations, and presents Proust as a novelist whose philosophical gifts were matched only by his irrepressible comic sense. Proust\'s Way, the culmination of a lifetime of scholarship, will serve as the next generation\'s guide to one of the world\'s finest writers of fiction.','W. W.

No writer has equaled Saint-Exupéry in describing the perilous and poetic experience of flying, in submission to what he calls “those damn elemental divinities—night, day, mountain, sea and storm.” In this gripping, beautifully written novel inspired by his experience as a pilot in South America, he tells of the brave men who pilot night mail planes from Patagonia, Chile, and Paraguay to Argentina in the early days of commercial aviation. They are impelled to perform their routine acts of heroism by a steely chief named Rivière, whose extraordinary character is revealed through the dramatic events of a single night.

D. Salinger\'s New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children\'s voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden\'s voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.','Little, Brown','1951-07-16','http://books.google.com/books?id=m3GzoAEACAAJ&dq=salinger+the+catcher+in+the+rye&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m3GzoAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api','m3GzoAEACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(668,'Jugurthine War And Conspiracy of Catiline','Not Present','Not Present','1963-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=lyKUwgEACAAJ&dq=sallust+jugurthine+war+conspiracy+of+catiline+handford&hl=&cd=2&source=gbs_api','https://i.imgur.com/fnVKr.gif','lyKUwgEACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(669,'Being and Nothingness','Sartre explains the theory of existential psychoanalysis in this treatise on human reality','Simon and Schuster','1992-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=L6igUcpDEO8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=sartre+being+and+nothingness+barnes&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=L6igUcpDEO8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','L6igUcpDEO8C','PH',NULL,1,2),(670,'Nausea','The diary of Antoine Roquentin follows his thoughts as he gradually sinks into a metaphysical crisis of despair, in this the first novel by the leader of French Existentialism','New Directions Publishing','1949-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=dbCJ40j7t1sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=sartres+nausea+carruth&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dbCJ40j7t1sC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','dbCJ40j7t1sC','PH',NULL,1,2),(671,'Age of Reason','Not Present','Not Present','1968-01-01','http://books.google.com/books?id=Ht8fcgAACAAJ&dq=sartre+the+age+of+reason+peyre&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','https://i.imgur.com/fnVKr.gif','Ht8fcgAACAAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(672,'No Exit and Three Other Plays','Four seminal plays by one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth century.

Zola\'s dispassionate dissection of the motivations of his characters, mere `human beasts\' who kill in order to satisfy their lust, is much more than an atmospheric Second Empire period-piece. Many readers were scandalized by an approach to character-drawing which seemed to undermine not only the moral values of a deeply conservative society, but also the whole code of psychological description on which the realist novel was based. Together with the important `Preface to the Second Edition\' in which Zola defended himself against charges of immorality, Thérèse Raquin stands as a key early manifesto of the French Naturalist movement, of which Zola was the founding father. Even today, this novel has lost none of its power to shock. This new translation is based on the second edition of 1868. The Introduction situates the novel in the context of Naturalism, medicine, and the scientific ideas of Zola\'s day.','Oxford Paperbacks','2008-07-10','http://books.google.com/books?id=7OujDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=zola+therese+raquin+rothwell&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7OujDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','7OujDwAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(685,'The Persian Expedition','In The Persian Expedition, Xenophon, a young Athenian noble who sought his destiny abroad, provides an enthralling eyewitness account of the attempt by a Greek mercenary army � the Ten Thousand � to help Prince Cyrus overthrow his brother and take the Persian throne.

Thirdly, the price of grain had risen to six shillings a saa, and famine threatened; fourthly, the Shehu and Shuwa sheiks were quarrelling again; and, fifthly, there was a very bad smallpox ju-ju abroad in the land (a secret society whose \"secret\" was to offer His Majesty\'s liege subjects the choice between being infected with smallpox, or paying heavy blackmail to the society). Lastly, there was acrimonious correspondence with the All-Wise Ones (of the Secretariat in \"Aiki Square\" at Zungeru), who, as usual, knew better than the man on the spot, and bade him do either the impossible or the disastrous. And across all the Harmattan was blowing hard, that terrible wind that carries the Saharan dust a hundred miles to sea, not so much as a sand-storm, but as a mist or fog of dust as fine as flour, filling the eyes, the lungs, the pores of the skin, the nose and throat; getting into the locks of rifles, the works of watches and cameras, defiling water, food and everything else; rendering life a burden and a curse. The fact, moreover, that thirty days\' weary travel over burning desert, across oceans of loose wind-blown sand and prairies of burnt grass, through breast-high swamps, and across unbridged boatless rivers, lay between him and Kano, added nothing to his satisfaction. For, in spite of all, satisfaction there was, inasmuch as Kano was rail-head, and the beginning of the first stage of the journey Home. That but another month lay between him and \"leave out of Africa,\" kept George Lawrence on his feet. From that wonderful and romantic Red City, Kano, sister of Timbuktu, the train would take him, after a three days\' dusty journey, to the rubbish-heap called Lagos, on the Bight of Benin of the wicked West African Coast. There he would embark on the good ship Appam, greet her commander, Captain Harrison, and sink into a deck chair with that glorious sigh of relief, known in its perfection only to those weary ones who turn their backs upon the Outposts and set their faces towards Home. Meantime, for George Lawrence--disappointment, worry, frustration, anxiety, heat, sand-flies, mosquitoes, dust, fatigue, fever, dysentery, malarial ulcers, and that great depression which comes of monotony indescribable, weariness unutterable, and loneliness unspeakable.','Library of Alexandria','2020-09-28','http://books.google.com/books?id=XiKRCwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=wren+beau+geste&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XiKRCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api','XiKRCwAAQBAJ','PH',NULL,1,2),(689,'To the Lighthouse','Inspired by her childhood summers in Cornwall, the author produced one of the masterworks of English literature.
